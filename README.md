# Comparative-analysis-of-solar-radiation-forecasting-between-LSTM-and-RF-model-using-machine-learning
This project is a comparative analysis of solar irradiation forecasting between LSTM and RF models using Machine Learning. Both models are employed and studied in this paper. The data used in this proposed work is for hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly solar irradiation data captured by a weather station. The R^2 and RMSE values for both models are computed and a comparative analysis is done. The result obtained using the LSTM (Long short-term memory) model is compared with the one obtained from the RF (Random Forest) model. This would further help in determining the most accurate model.
